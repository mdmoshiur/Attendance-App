# Attendance-project
This is my attendance app project. In this app, the user can take attendance in a class. The app has a google drive backup feature using google drive rest API. The user can export the summary of class as a pdf document with each student percentage of attendance. Other all necessary features are contained in this app like updating, take the previous class attendance as today's attendance, add a new student in the class, etc.
